            Hi, I am a Student at GIAIC currently pursuing a course in Artificial Intelligence, Web 3.0, & Metaverse. Although, I am from accounting and finance background from IBA. But in GIAIC I got a new found interest in coding and now after learning coding for almost a year with so many projects in-hand, i feel really comfortable with this field and have developed my expertise in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NEXT.JS and React. Looking forward I am learning to leverage AI in this dynamic field as a developer and will continue to seek new things in this field inorder to stay with time in today's rapidly evolving world.
